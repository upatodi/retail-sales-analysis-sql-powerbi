### 1. Top Performing Products
```sql
SELECT `Product Name`,

FROM superstore
GROUP BY `Product Name`
ORDER BY total_profit DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
**Insight:**
1. Printers and accessories generate the highest profits.

FROM superstore
GROUP BY `Region`
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;

       MONTH(`Order Date`) AS order_month,
       ROUND(SUM(`Sales`), 2) AS monthly_sales,
       ROUND(SUM(`Profit`), 2) AS monthly_profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY order_year, order_month
ORDER BY order_year, order_month;
```
**Insight:**
1. Sales peak during Novemberâ€“December (holiday season).
2. Profitability fluctuates, suggesting discount-heavy months.

```sql
WITH customer_metrics AS (

           COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
           SUM(`Sales`) AS lifetime_sales,
           SUM(`Profit`) AS lifetime_profit,
           ROUND(AVG(`Sales`), 2) AS avg_order_value
    FROM superstore

)
SELECT `Customer Name`,
       total_orders,
       ROUND(lifetime_sales, 2) AS lifetime_sales,

       avg_order_value
FROM customer_metrics
ORDER BY lifetime_profit DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
